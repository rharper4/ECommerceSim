# **Java E-Commerce System: An Introductory Project**

## **Overview**
This Java project serves as my introduction to developing backend systems, focusing on a simplified e-commerce platform for technology products. It showcases basic functionalities essential to online shopping experiences, including product listing, cart management, and a rudimentary checkout process. Designed with beginners in mind, it provides a straightforward example of applying Java programming principles in a practical context.

## **Key Features**
**Simple Product Management:** Demonstrates how to add, list, and manage products within an in-memory list without a database.
**Basic Cart Functionality:** Implements a cart where users can add or remove items, showcasing fundamental array manipulation.
**Mock Payment Processing:** Introduces a simple payment verification logic for educational purposes, without real financial transactions.
## **Technologies Used**

**Java:** The primary language for all backend logic in this codebase.

**Swing (JOptionPane):** Offers a basic graphical user interface to interact with the system through dialog boxes.
## **How to Run**

 - **Set Up Your Java Environment:** Ensure Java is installed on your system.

- **Compile the Program:** Use the command 'javac CommerceSystem.java' in your terminal within the project directory.


- **Launch the Application:** Execute the program with 'java CommerceSystem' and interact with it through the JOptionPane dialogs.

## **Contributions**
